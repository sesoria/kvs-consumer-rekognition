Amazon Kinesis Video Stream (KVS) Consumer Library for Python. 

This library parses streaming bytes (chunks) made available by the StreamingBody returned from calls 
to the KVS Media Client GetMedia and KVS Archive Media Client GetMediaForFragmentList
API. 

The Amazon Kinesis Video Stream (KVS) Consumer Library for Python reads in streaming bytes as they become 
available and parses to individual MKV fragments. The library is threaded and non-blocking, 
once a stream is being read it forwards received MKV fragments to named call-backs in the users application.

Fragments are returned as raw bytes and a searchable DOM like structure by parsing with EMBLite by MideTechnology.

The consumer library provides the following functions to further process parsed MKV fragments:
1) get_fragment_tags(): Extract MKV tags from the fragment.
2) save_fragment_as_local_mkv(): Saves the fragment as stand-alone MKV file on local disk.
3) get_frames_as_ndarray(): Returns a ratio of frames in the fragment as a list of NDArray objects.
4) save_frames_as_jpeg(): Returns a ratio of frames in the fragment as a JPEGs to local disk.

Workflow:
1) Define a on_fragment_arrived and on_read_stream_complete call-backs in user application logic. These to process
fragments as they are received and to handle the parser reaching the end of the stream. (When no more fragments are left),
2) Initialize the KVS Media and / or Archive Media clients,
3) Make a call to KVS Media GetMedia and / or KVS Archive Media GetMediaForFragmentList for the given stream,
4) Initialize this KVS Consumer library and call get_streaming_fragements providing the response from the GetMedia
or GetMediaForFragmentList call,
5) Fragments will then be parsed and delivered to the call-backs for processing as per the example code provided.

    def run(self):
        '''
        Reads in chunks (unframed number of raw bytes) from a KVS GetMedia or GetMediaForFragmentList Streaming Body response 
        and parses into bounded MKV fragments. Raw data is buffered until a complete fragment is received which is then forwarded to the 
        on_fragmemt_arrived callback. Fragment is delivered as a raw byte array and also a parsed EBMLite Document that is a DOM like 
        structure of the elements (including Tags) within the given Fragment. 

        Kinesis Video will continually update the streaming buffer with media as soon as its available. For StartSelectorType = NOW,
        bytes from the media stream will be available as fast as they arrive into Kinesis Video by the producer. In this case the 
        consumer bandwidth and fragment rate will be equal to that of the producer. However, if StartSelector is set to sometime 
        in the past then all fragments from start to end time will be available immediately. The effect is this will 
        read in bytes as fast as the system resources (KVS limits, CPU and bandwidth) will allow until the stream has 
        caught up with the leading edge of media being generated.
